    "1. Learn.co: section-17: All the notebooks in this section is pretty useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extra Readings: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - [Stanford - Probability for Computer Scientists - Lecture notes - Sections Counting and Probability](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/courseReader.html)\n",
    "    - [PennState - Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics - Section-1: Introduction to probability](https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/5/)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extra videos and play lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [Probability and Statistics for Business and Data Science ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-i8do33HJoutVeQXSO1Qly92hThW2jbJ) : From this play list you can watch, 'what is probability', 'permutations', 'combinations', 'conditional probability', 'Bayes' theorem'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Day-2  -  Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn.co: Section-18: You might skip skewness and kurtosis, Poisson and exponential distributions in your first reading but the rest of the material is pretty fundamental. In the labs there might have some typos, please check with the coaches if you think that this is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extra Readings: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - [PennState - Stats 414/415 - Section-2-3](https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/48/) : In section-2 you can read lesson 7,8 and 10. In section-3, lessons 13, 14 and 16 are relevant to our material.\n",
    "    - [Stanford Probability for Computer Scientists](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/courseReader.html): Note that this material here might be more theoretical than some other resources. Lessons 4,5 and 6 are relevant for day-2 material.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extra videos and play lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [A student's Guide to Bayesian Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_og8H-VkIY&list=PLwJRxp3blEvZ8AKMXOy0fc0cqT61GsKCG): This videos are from the author of the book 'A student's guide to Bayesian Statistics' so first hand material. lectures 2,3 and 4 are relevant materials for day-2.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - [Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOr0NKyD31Q): Khan Academy's videos are always a good introduction for complicated topics. So I add these here for the ones who wants a smooth and through introduction. Lessons 1-4 are relevant for day-2.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Day-3 - Central Limit Theorem - P values, Z score etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn.co: Section 19-20: All the notebooks in learn.co is relevant and important for this section. For day-3 though you stop reading after section-20 lesson P-values and the null-hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extra Readings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [Statistics How to](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/probability-and-statistics/normal-distributions/central-limit-theorem-definition-examples/): Not my favorite but it is still nice combination of examples, explanations and videos. Check it and you decide whether they serve to your taste or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [PennState - Stats 200](https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat200/lesson/4): This course is more introductory than stats 414/415 so it might be easier to read. The only handicap is they are not using python as software but it doesn't affect following the material. Also this is a little bit tangential to our material.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Stanford- Probability for Computer Scientists](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109/courseReader.html): lessons 9, 10. Especially lesson 10 is a little bit too technical. So if you don't feel comfortable with your mathematics background this might not be a good first stop. I would pass this one. \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Extra videos and play lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [StatsQuest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBigTkBLU6g&list=PLblh5JKOoLUK0FLuzwntyYI10UQFUhsY9): He has very annoying songs but overall he explains concepts very well. Lessons 9,10 and 20 are relevant for day-3.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Day-4 - Hypothesis Testing and A/B Testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learn.co: Section-20: All of the material from section-20 is relevant and important. May be you can skip the effect size notebook in your first read.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Extra Readings:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [PennState Stat 415](https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/290/): These will be a lot more in details than what we will cover in the class but the material explained very well so it might be worth to spend some time here. Especially lessons 37, 38 and 39 will be relevant with day-4 material. \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Extra videos and play lists: \n",
    "\n",
    "    [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLblh5JKOoLUK0FLuzwntyYI10UQFUhsY9): There are many nice videos here that are relevant to the material we will be covering. Especially you can check, lessons 20,22 and 23.\n",
