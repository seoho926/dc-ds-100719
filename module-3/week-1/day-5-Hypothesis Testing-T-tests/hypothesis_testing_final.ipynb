Recently, local citizens have been concerned that the reading program in the public schools may be an inferior one. Since this is a serious issue, you decide to conduct an experiment to investigate the matter. You set $\\alpha = 0.05$ one-tail test for making your decision. You begin by comparing the reading level of current high school seniors with established norms. The norms are based on scores from a reading proficiency test administered nationally to a large number of high school seniors. Using the data blow write null and alternative hypotheses to understand whether there is any significant difference between the school district and national kids."
